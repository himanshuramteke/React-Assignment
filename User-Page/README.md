# Instagram-Inspired User Page using React Functionalities
This project aims to replicate Instagram's user page using React.
The primary focus is on implementing conditional rendering, allowing users to choose between signing up and logging in. 
The interface dynamically adjusts to display relevant input fields based on the user's selection.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, the goal is to create a user page similar to Instagram, leveraging React's functional components. 
The main task is to achieve conditional rendering, enabling users to make a choice between signing up and logging in.
The UI should adapt, showing distinct input fields depending on their selection. 
For signup, additional registration inputs should appear, while login should display only the basic username and password fields.

## Project Requirements
Create a React application from scratch or use an existing one.
Implement conditional rendering to toggle between sign up and login views.
Design an intuitive user interface resembling Instagram's layout.
